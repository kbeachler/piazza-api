When I run my code through the Python shell, everything works out well and gives me the same output that the assignment suggests. However, when I submitted the assignment to Gradescope, it says that my code has failed three tests, and gives me this message:\u00a0\n\nTest Failed: 'float' object is not callable\nI am unsure of how to revolve this error, as my code appeared to work on my end. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\npa1.py\n\nThank you,\n\nAva DeLuca\nA18123567",

The key difference here is the indentation. In the first example, only the very first values for x and y will be checked, since we will encounter a return statement and exit the function no matter what. If the pixels we check are a 1, we will return \"Illegitimate\" and if none of those if statements are True, we return \"Legitimate\". This is incorrect, since we need to check ALL possible edge pixels before we can say for sure that our pool is legitimate.\u00a0\n\nThe second piece of code does this correctly, since it will only return \"Legitimate\" after all possible edge pixels have been checked, and no violations were found.

However, I don't know why the function says test_mirror and that on the file pa6-test.py, it tells me to call the mirror function. The instructions seem to be the same for the second test function as well, where the instructions tell me to test the crop function when it is called test_add_stamp.Does the test case require me to use the blend (chromascale) function on the original cat image, then test the mirror function on that modified image?
