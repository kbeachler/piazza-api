The object that rgb_square points to (the 2D list of tuples) is what is passed in as a parameter to the make_copy function, where it is now also represented by the local variable img, upon being pased in.\nAnd copy_img contains a reference to the same object as rgb_square in the rgb_square = part of the function call. Here, the object outputted by make_copy (which is copy_img, as it is returned by the function) is newly assigned to the rgb_square variable.\nimg and copy_img do not refer to the same object at any point; img first refers to the same object as rgb_square, then rgb_square is reassigned to contain a reference to the same object as copy_img.\n\nAnd, to answer your second question, the two are indeed closely related. A reference is a name that refers to the specific location in memory of a value (object); id() produces the numerical value that is the memory address for the object (generally supposed to be unique for an object during its lifetime).",
